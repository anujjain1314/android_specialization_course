# android_specialization_course

This course on course taught me how to program core features and 
classes from the Java programming language that are used 
in Android, which is the dominant platform for developing and 
deploying mobile device apps. 

In particular, this course covers key Java programming language features that control the flow of execution 
through an app (such as Javaâ€™s various looping constructs and conditional statements), 
enable access to structured data (such as Java's built-in arrays and common classes in the Java Collections Framework, 
such as ArrayList and HashMap), group related operations and data into
classes and interfaces (such as Java's primitive and user-defined types, fields, methods, generic parameters, and exceptions), 
customize the behavior of existing classes via inheritance and polymorphism (such as subclassing and overriding virtual methods). 

I have will applied these Java features in the context of core Android components (such as Activities and basic UI elements) 
by applying common tools (such as Android Studio) needed to develop Java programs and useful Android apps.  

I have worked on work on several hands-on projects throughout the course.
